libbeanstalkclient.

This is a non blocking implementation of a beanstalk client.
It is ment to be embeded in event loops like libevent/libev.

This library is still under development!!

Dependencies:

arrayqueue.h: http://github.com/bergundy/arrayqueue
ioqueue library: http://github.com/bergundy/IOQueue
libbeanstalkproto (The protocol implementation): http://github.com/bergundy/libbeanstalkproto
sockutils (a simple socket library i wrote to avoid rewriting socket code): http://github.com/bergundy/sockutils

To enable tests you will need check (http://check.sourceforge.net/)

TODO:

1. Create a function for each beanstalk command to replace the BSC_ENQ_CMD macro.
2. Create a list/hash of watched/used tubes so when the client reconnects it will restore it's old state.
3. Deal with multiple beanstalkd servers.
